# Iris-Species-Project
In this project we create and train our model on the famous Iris dataset.In the end,our model is able to accurately identify which species of flower is given with the 
help of it's given features.
# About data
The Iris dataset was used in R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper, The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems, and can also be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, 
but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.
The columns in this dataset are:
Id
SepalLengthCm
SepalWidthCm
